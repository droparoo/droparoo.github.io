Following expiration of the Initial Term, Droparoo may increase the fees payable by Customer under this Agreement, upon not less than forty-five (45) days' written notice prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.

TERMINATTION & SUSPENSION.
In the event of breach of this Agreement by Customer, Droparoo may terminate this Agreement by giving Customer written notice specifying the nature of the breach in reasonable detail and Droparoo’s intention to terminate (a "Termination Notice"). If the breach has not been cured within the period ending ten (10) days following delivery of the Termination Notice, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate. If Customer is in breach of any of the following provisions of this Agreement: license restrictions of Section 7, the payment terms of Section 4, or the confidentiality restrictions of Section 10, then Droparoo may immediately suspend or terminate Customer's use of the Services. Any such suspension shall not relieve Customer of any of its obligations under this Agreement or entitle Customer to any refund of payments previously made. 
Droparoo may suspend Customer’s access to the Services immediately without notice if Droparoo, in its sole discretion, believes: (1) such suspension is required by law; (2) Customer has breached this Agreement; or (3) there is a security or privacy risk to Customer. Any suspension of Customer’s access to the Services will not limit or waive Droparoo’s rights to terminate this Agreement or Customer’s access to the Services. 
Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall discontinue its use of the Services. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, termination of this Agreement by Droparoo shall not limit Customer's obligation to pay all of the applicable fees, nor restrict Droparoo from pursuing any other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief. Sections 4, 7-10, 12 and 14-19 shall survive termination of this Agreement, along with any other provisions that are intended by their terms to survive. 
Customer agrees that following termination of Customer’s account and/or use of the Services, Droparoo may immediately deactivate Customer’s account and delete Customer data.
